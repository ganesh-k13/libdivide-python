# libdivide-python
libdivide binding for python

## Installation
You may install it like any other python package.

For local testing

```sh
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

## Usage
TODO

## Disclaimer
1. I don't remember writing most of this package (about a year ago).
   Making it public in case anyone wants to experiment on it
2. I've intergrated libdivide to NumPy via [ENH: Added libdivide for floor divide](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17727)
   which should be preferred way to use libdivide in python

## TODOs
1. Added vendored license
2. Right now, it gives 0 for few cases :), need to debug
